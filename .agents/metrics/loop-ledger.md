# Loop ledger

Every review loop this repository runs, one row each, permanently.

**Why this exists.** Until 2026-07-27 nothing here recorded a single review
round, so every claim about whether our workflow was working — including the
claim that it was getting worse — was unfalsifiable. Two attempts to
characterise our own history by recollection produced numbers that were later
withdrawn as wrong. This file exists so that the next such claim can be
checked.

**Who appends.** Both Claude Code and Codex, at every loop close. The normative
obligation is in
[`docs/ai-context/working-modes.md`](../../docs/ai-context/working-modes.md#the-loop-ledger)
— shared, because both agents run feature and bugfix loops independently and a
ledger missing one agent's work would look complete while being wrong.

## The two halves of a row, and why they are separated

**Mechanical columns are produced by `scripts/loop-metrics.mjs` and are never
typed by hand.** Run `node scripts/loop-metrics.mjs --pr <number>`.

**Judgment columns are typed by hand and are marked as such**, because no
script can infer them. Keeping the halves visually distinct is the point: a
number that looks derived but was recalled is worse than an obvious estimate,
since it borrows credibility it has not earned.

| Column | Half | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| `pr`, `cohort`, `files`, `+lines`, `-lines` | mechanical | Cohort is first-match top-down: `plan-review` → `prose/contract` (incl. mixed) → `bugfix` → `feature/code`, keyed primarily on the bugfix PR body's required `**Fix tier:**` field, not title wording. **Both `+lines` and `-lines` are kept** — `artifactSize()` derives both because neither alone is size, and a table that drops `-lines` on paste would make a large deletion-heavy change look trivial. |
| `rounds` | mechanical | **Completed reviewer review events** — not `@codex review` comments. The connector auto-reviews non-draft PRs on open, so counting triggers undercounts implementation PRs by one and draft plan-review PRs by zero: a bias present in one cohort and absent in the other. |
| `findings` | mechanical | **Reviewer-authored root comments**, one per thread. Author replies are excluded — our workflow mandates a reply per thread, which roughly doubles a raw comment count. |
| `review hrs` | mechanical | PR open → final reviewer event. **One interval, never a sum.** Preflight time occurring after the PR opens is already inside it. |
| `new / prop / wrong / re-raised` | **judgment** | Cause per finding. Ambiguous cases default to self-inflicted, biasing the metric *against* the workflow so drift cannot quietly flatter it. |
| `pre-open preflight` | **judgment** | Minutes of preflight *before* the PR existed — the only preflight cost outside `review hrs`. Add this to `review hrs` for total; never add post-open passes. |
| `adjudicated` | **judgment** | `max(1, ceil(0.3 × findings))` findings re-classified blind by a fresh-context reader. `>20%` disagreement ⇒ that loop's causal figure is **`unmeasured`** and is excluded from the trend, not counted as good news. |

**`re-raised` is a judgment column on purpose.** A re-raised prior finding is
not newly surfaced ground, but "Reconciliation" has no machine-readable
marker — `plan-review-contract.md` names it only in prose and
`code-review.md` does not define the category at all. Excluding it by regex
would be a guess wearing the costume of a measurement, so the script counts
these and a human separates them.

**The primary metric is the self-inflicted *finding* share** —
`(prop + wrong) / findings` — trending toward zero. **Round count is recorded,
never targeted.** A long loop that is nearly all new ground is the loop
working; a short loop with a high self-inflicted share is worse than a long
clean one, and a round target would score both backwards.

## Rows

| # | pr | cohort | files | +lines | -lines | rounds | findings | new | prop | wrong | re-raised | self-infl. | review hrs | pre-open preflight | adjudicated | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [#268](https://github.com/TheAnswerManIsHere/Overhypeme/pull/268) | prose/contract | 8 | 744 | 214 | 18 | 40 | 16 | 19 | 5 | 0 | **60%** | — | none | ✗ **unadjudicated** | Baseline. Bugfix-mode rework. |
| 2 | [#269](https://github.com/TheAnswerManIsHere/Overhypeme/pull/269) | plan-review | 1 | 1111 | 0 | 7 | 40 | 28 | 6 | 5 | 1 | **27.5%** | — | none | ✗ **unadjudicated** | Closed unmerged. Artifact grew 315→1111 lines (corrected from an earlier 1092 — that was a mid-review `wc -l`, not the file's state at its actual final commit `57ae1148`). `-lines` is genuinely 0: the file was new to `main`, so the base→head diff cannot show a removal of pre-existing content, even though the loop itself rewrote large sections in place across its revisions. |

### Row provenance — read before using these numbers

Both rows are **retrospective and were entered by hand**, because the script
did not exist while these loops ran. They are the baseline the ledger measures
against, not output of the mechanism it describes.

- **#268's** rounds and findings are corroborated: counted independently from
  the squash-merge commit history by both Claude and Codex, who agreed on 18
  and 40. The causal split is Claude's classification, and an earlier estimate
  of it (35/40/25) was **wrong and withdrawn** — the figures here are the
  per-finding recount.
- **#269's** columns were tracked live in the PR body's findings ledger as the
  loop ran. The causal split is Claude's own classification of Claude's own
  errors, which is exactly the conflict the adjudication column exists to
  check.
- **Neither row is adjudicated.** The 27.5% and 60% figures should be read as
  the author's account, not as measurements, until a blind re-classification
  runs. **#268 is the designated acceptance replay**: if blind adjudication of
  its 40 findings disagrees beyond 20%, the causal metric is not yet
  trustworthy and must be reported as such rather than reported at all.
- **`review hrs` is absent** for both: it needs API timestamps the script now
  derives but that were never captured for these loops. Blank means *not
  measured*, never *zero*.

**The first row produced by the mechanism**, rather than recalled into it, will
be this ledger's own implementation PR — computed once it closes and folded
into whichever PR comes next, per `working-modes.md`'s *"a row is never its own
dedicated PR"*. Not a dedicated ledger-only PR: that would require its own
review, whose own close would owe another row, forever.
